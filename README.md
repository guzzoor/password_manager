# password_manager

Passwords are of great importance. People are in general very bad at using good passwords,
and this Python program are meant to be of help for that. 

For the final product:
This program should be able to generate passwords that are hard to crack but easy to 
remember relative to how hard it is to crack. 

I will myself use this together with a password manager. Use the program to generate passwords
and let the manager keep track of them. This is the most basic feature. The program will also 
do some calculations about the passwords, liken entropy and how hard it is to crack. 

The program should not save any password, better to let a manager to do so. It should
however track the last time the password was changed and when its time to change it again
give a notification.
